Image classification is one of the most significant study topics in image processing, and it has been the focus of research for many years due to the diversity and complexity of image information. Given the inadequacy of existing image classification models to properly utilize picture information, this projectÂ offers a unique image classification approach that combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), two exceptional classifiers. The given CNN-XGBoost model produces more exact results by combining CNN as a trainable feature extractor to automatically obtain features from input and XGBoost as a recognizer on the top level of the network to provide results.
